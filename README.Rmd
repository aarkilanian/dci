The `dci` package provides an R interface to the Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) allowing for the analysis of longitudinal connectivity in river networks. Given a set of spatial data representing river lines, barrier point locations and the location of the target watershed's outlet the `dci` package provides tools to calculate ecological connectivity with the DCI. There are options to calculate the potamodromous or diadromous form of the DCI as well as options to consider a distance threshold and/or weights to be applied to river lengths.

This package extends the tidy representation of geospatial network data from the [sfnetworks package](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/). This provides access to a rich set of further network analysis tools from the [tidygraph package](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html) as well as data manipulation from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of packages.

## Installation
