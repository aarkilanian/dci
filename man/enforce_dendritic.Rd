\usage{
enforce_dendritic(
  rivers,
  min_comp = 10,
  divergence = TRUE,
  complex = TRUE,
  export = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rivers}{A \code{\link{rivers}} object returned by \code{\link{import_rivers}}.}

\item{min_comp}{An integer value, the minimum number of river line segments in a network component. Isolated networks with less than this specified number of edges will be discarded. Set to 10 by default.}

\item{divergence}{A logical value, when \code{TRUE}, the default, divergences are corrected.}

\item{complex}{A logical value, when \code{TRUE}, the default, complex confluences are corrected.}

\item{export}{A logical value, when \code{FALSE}, the default, errors are automatically corrected. When \code{TRUE} errors are identified and returned.}
}
\value{
If \code{export} is \code{FALSE}, a \code{rivers} object with corrected dendritic topology. If \code{export} is \code{TRUE}, a \code{rivers} object with divergent river pairs given shared \code{divID} and rivers participating in complex confluences are given shared \code{complexID}.
}
\description{
This function provides an interface to tools which can correct non-dendritic geometries in a river network. This tool can correct divergent rivers and complex confluences.
}
\details{
Divergent rivers are parts of a river network where a single tributary splits into two after a confluence. In a dendritic network small upstream rivers can only combine at confluences into a single river.

Complex confluences occur when confluences have over 2 input tributaries. In a dendritic network two tributaries only must combine into one at confluences.

If errors are being corrected manually, all divergent pairs must be reduced to only one river and complex confluences modified such that only 2 rivers join together.
